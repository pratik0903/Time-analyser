# Time-Tracker
Time-tracker is simple commandline based application which can be used to track of apps and softwares that we use daily. It is similar to digital wellbeing but made for Windows. 
For storing data, json file is used. App generates json file named `tracker.json` where it stores its all data. As of now `main.py` or executable file of `main.py` needs to be run initially in command prompt (afterwards you need leave that command prompt runnning in background). App will collect data until the command prompt gets interrupted.
`tracker.json` file will get created in same folder from where script is running in terminal
